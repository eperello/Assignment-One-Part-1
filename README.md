# CMPS 2200  Assignment 01

To complete this assignment, follow the instructions in this document. Some of your answers will go in this file, and others will require you to edit `main.py`.


## Setup
- Make sure you have a Github account.
- Login to Github.
- Login to repl.it, using "sign in with github"
- Click on the assignment link sent through canvas and accept the assignment. 
- Click on your personal github repository for the assignment.
- Login in Repls https://replit.com/repls and then create a new replit by importing from github repository.
- You'll work with a partner to complete this recitation. To do so, we'll break you into Zoom rooms. You will be able to code together in the same `repl.it` instance. You can choose whose repl.it instance you will share. This person will click the "Share" button in their repl.it instance and email the lab partner.
- Make sure the dependencies are installed. Please use 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.

## Running and testing your code
- In the command-line window, run `./ipy` to launch an interactive IPython shell. This is an interactive shell to help run and debug your code. Any code you change in `main.py` will be reflected from this shell. So, you can modify a function in `main.py`, then test it here.
  + If it seems things don't refresh, try running `from main import *`
- You can exit the IPython prompt by either typing `exit` or pressing `ctrl-d`
- To run tests, from the command-line shell, you can run
  + `pytest main.py` will run all tests
  + `pytest main.py::test_one` will just run `test_one`
  + We recommend running one test at a time as you are debugging.

## Turning in your work

- Once complete, click on the "Version Control" icon in the left pane on repl.it.
- Enter a commit message in the "what did you change?" text box
- Click "commit and push." This will push your code to your github repository.
- Although you are working as a team, please have each team member submit the same code to their repository. One person can copy the code to their repl.it and submit it from there.
